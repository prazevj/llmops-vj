``` Key Components:
1. Dockerfile

Multi-stage build for optimized image size
Non-root user for security
Health check endpoint
Proper Python dependencies management

2. Docker Compose Setup

Development: docker-compose.yml with hot reload
Production: docker-compose.prod.yml with optimizations
Services: FastAPI app, MySQL, Redis, Nginx

3. Database Setup

MySQL 8.0 with initialization script
Proper health checks and dependencies
Volume persistence for data

4. Configuration Files

Environment variables management
Nginx reverse proxy configuration
Comprehensive .dockerignore

Quick Start:
Development:
bash# Clone/setup your project
git clone <your-repo>
cd <your-project>

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Build and start services
make build
make up

# View logs
make logs

# Access API
curl http://localhost:8000/health
Production:
bash# Set production environment variables
export DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password

# Build and start production services
make prod-build
make prod-up
Directory Structure:
